# etch-a-sketch

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch

What I learned:
- how to create a CSS grid
- how to set the track sizing of grid columns with "grid-template-columns"
- how to set track sizing to be the same for several columns using "repeat"
- how to add an event listener for when a 'mouseenter's a given area
- how to remove all child nodes of a parent node in JavaScript
- how to get a random rgb value 
- how to use 'getComputedStyle' to get the background color using JavaScript
- how to get the individual "r", "g", "b", and "a" values from the "rgba()" string
